    "* Ans: An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of attributes or properties, and code in the form of methods)."

    "* Method: A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "  1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. \n",
    "  2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)."
